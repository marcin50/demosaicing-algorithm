# Demosaicing algorithm
Small machine learning project using linear regression. 

## Notes
The linear regression algorithm is used to predict missing pixel values in the input Bayer image based on predetermined coefficients. The coefficients are determined through a machine learning technique which uses complete images to train the model.
